    <h1>1. Psychological disorders :</h1>

    <p>
         Commonly called mental disorders, are a
wide range of conditions that affect the mood,
thinking or behaviour. These affect multiple
areas of life and create distress for the person
suffering from it. Some of the major categories
of psychological disorders are - Intellectual
disability (formerly known as mental
retardation), Autism spectrum disorder, bipolar
disorder, depression, anxiety disorder, ADHD
(Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder), and
stress related disorders.

    <h1>2. Parkinson's disease :</h1>
    <p>Degeneration of dopamine-producing
        neurons in the CNS causes Parkinson's disease.
        Symptoms develop gradually over the years.
        Symptoms are tremors, stiffness, difficulty in
        walking, balance and co-ordination.</p>
        
    <br>

    
    <h1>3. Alzheimer’s disease :</h1>
    <p> It is the most common form of dementia.
        Its incidence increases with the age, showing
        the loss of cognitive functioning -thinking,
        remembering, reasoning and behavioral
        abilities to such an extent that it interferes with
        the persons daily life and activities. It occurs
        due to loss of cholinergic and other neurons in
        the CNS, accumulation of amyloid proteins.
        There is no cure for Alzheimer’s, but treatment
        slows down the progression of the disease and
        may improve the quality of life.</p>
